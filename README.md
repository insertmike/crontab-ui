User friendly task scheduler with __crontab__
--

Project motivation
--

As a team we aim to simplify the use of command-line commands that aim to schedule tasks for the user, by building a user friendly interface for a 'task scheduler', which otherwise is not very user friendly. 

How it works?
--

1. Run the script by typing the following in to the console/terminal: ```<filename.sh>```
2. You are presented with a menu with numbered options to manage your tasks.
3. Select an option by typing in the console the corresponding number to that command, ie: ```1. Display all jobs``` will display all current active scheduled jobs once you press ```1```


Requirements

No requirements...lol...jk. Only works in Linux/Ubuntu/Unix OS ;)
